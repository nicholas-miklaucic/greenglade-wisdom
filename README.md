## What Is This?
This is a tool inspired by [/u/Telebait's excellent post on the LoR
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfRuneterra/comments/lhr64g/i_put_together_this_cheatsheet_of_the_keycards_to/)
showing a cheat sheet of key cards to play around. I thought it could be adapted to an interactive format to make it
easier to read the card text and this was the result! The other inspiration for this site was [swim's
site](https://www.swimstrim.com/runeterra/matchup-tips), which I think is out of maintenance. 

This is definitely a work in progress: file an issue or a pull request if you see anything that needs fixing or
improvement.
## Why is [insert X card] here or not here?
This is a list about cards you can play into by accident. The example I use on the site itself is Solari Sunforger vs.
Radiant Guardian. They're both conditional Lifesteal units, but one is on the list and the other isn't. There are a fair
amount of games I've played against a Demacia player who makes a weird open attack on turn 5 and, after I go "huh,
that's weird" and block, play Radiant Guardian and make me facepalm. Sunforger doesn't have that same self-destructive
quality: it's just a good card you see your opponent play.

Similarly, Twisted Fate's Red Card is a play you can give a lot of value if you play 1-health units on turn 4 after a
soft pass: even though you can't deny TF entirely, you can lessen the value he gives your opponent.

That being said, feel free to opine on what cards you'd like to see added! I'll take it under consideration.

## Why not just go to Mobalytics or Swim's site and see what meta decks are running?
You can do that, and it will help you win games. But there's a reason Swim had a page like this: on ladder you don't
necessarily know that your opponent is running the optimal version of any particular archetype, and you're completely on
your own if you're playing against a homebrew. Losing to Scouts is bad enoughâ€”losing to a Kalista Back Alley Barkeep
deck that blew you out with The Box after you played The Golden Sister and Aphelios is a lot harder on the ego. The hint
text will also try to, well, hint at what decks might run a card or not.

This list tries to strike the right balance between "how common is this" and "how bad is it if I play into this card". 
Cards like Judgment aren't that common but are instant game winnners if allowed to be. Cards like Sharpsight can't win
the game on the spot, but basically every Demacia deck will run it so it's worth playing against more.

## What about that hint text?
I'd like to have a little blurb for each card, but that's a lot of writing and so it's still a work in progress. The
hints I currently have are stored in the hints.json file. Feel free to submit a pull request to add information!
