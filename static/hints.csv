Card Name,Card Text
Default,This is where explanatory text about what decks run this card and how to play around it will be.
Ranger's Resolve,"This is often run in Scouts, Bannermen, or other wide Demacia decks."
Sharpsight,"You should assume this is in every Demacia deck you face. Keep in mind that it lets your opponent block Elusives: if you can't protect your e.g., Ezreal after this spell, don't attack with him."
Riposte,"This is mostly run in Fiora decks, although it is sometimes seen in Scouts. This is Fiora's champion spell, so it's extra likely if she's on the field."
Single Combat,"This is run in almost every Demacia deck, although most modern Scouts versions cut it."
Concerted Strike,This is run in Fiora/Shen decks and Demacia/Targon decks most commonly. Keep in mind that the order matters on your opponent's strikes: you can often prevent Fiora from getting a kill even if you can't keep your unit alive.
Judgment,"This isn't that common of a card, although it is Garen's champion spell. It's a very powerful tech choice, though, so be very careful around it. The story on the side may be inspired by real events."
For The Fallen,Can be very low-cost if they drew it early. Run primarily in Elites decks.
Relentless Pursuit,This is very common in Demacia decks: don't commit all of your mana if they still have 3 and you'd lose to this card. It's most common on your attack turns so they get the Scout attack as well.
Radiant Guardian,"Most common in Demacia/Targon decks, although it can be run in lots of Demacia decks. If they make weird suicide attacks at 5+ mana assume they're setting it up."
Jettison,"If they have 19 or fewer cards, they can use Jettison to give +3/+3 to all of their Sea Monsters at Burst speed. If they have 23 or fewer, they can do the same with double Jettison."
Make It Rain,"If they're blocking to set up lots of cards at 1 health, it's usually to set this up or to set up TF's Red Card. Also MF's champion spell."
Mind Meld,Run mainly in Fizz/TF decks and a bit of a meme in anything else. Keep a rough tally of how many spells they've played and hold removal until they play it.
Hired Gun,A common card to forget about and give unnecessary value. 
Twisted Fate,"Red Card can be devastating if played into: they can only do this once while TF lives, so bait it out and then play your weak units. In the mirror, don't play your TF first if he'd die to Gold Card."
Devourer of the Depths,The only Bilgewater Obliterate card. Keep in mind they can use Jettison or Salvage to give it more health at Burst speed. 
Riptide Rex,"Not as common since the nerf, but often a 3-of in Ganglpank or TF/Ezreal decks. Can be played around by flooding the board."
Transfusion,One of the only health-adding combat tricks in Noxus. Mainly run in Crimson decks. Vladimir's champion spell.
Brothers' Bond,Not common: mainly run in Darrowing or spiders Noxus aggro decks. Don't get greedy if your Nexus is going down to 4 and they have this up.
Ravenous Flock,"Can be seen in basically any Noxus deck and should always be played around. Don't take greedy blocks with units you need to keep alive. Swain's champion spell, so if they have Swain and play The Leviathan they have this."
Death Lotus,Not common but can have massive value. Katarina's champion spell. 
Noxian Fervor,"Run mainly in Pirate Burn and Swain decks for the 6 non-combat damage. Can be interrupted, so keep your removal until they play it."
Decimate,"Darius's champion spell. If this would kill you, open attack. Generated by Captain Farron."
Arachnoid Sentry,"Run in Swain and Draven/EZ decks as a development punish: if you have a unit like Kallista that really wants to attack, you need to open attack: Noxus doesn't have cheap fast-speed Stuns."
Sharpened Resolve,"A bit over-costed and so not especially common, but played in Riven decks."
Survival Skills,Casting it isn't the problem: discarding it is. One of the only forms of protection Noxus can run. Does not protect against kill effects like Scorched Earth.
Spinning Axe,"Not a big threat on its own, but it can set up Vision or Survival Skills. Play around both of these if they have a Spinning Axe in their hand."
Vision,This can be triggered at 0 mana through Poro Cannon or Spinning Axe and is a very dangerous card in Draven/Jinx aggro.
Decisive Maneuver,"Run primarily in Overwhelm decks as a very dangerous finisher. The only fast-speed Stun in Noxus, so if you're playing against Overwhelm you should develop into lethal attacks."
Mark of the Isles,"Run primarily in SI aggro: Fearsomes, They Who Endure, Nightfall, or Ephemerals. Don't take greedy blocks."
Vile Feast,"Run in all sorts of SI decks, especially SI/Freljord control and spiders."
Black Spear,"Kallista's champion spell, although not commonly maindecked. "
The Box,Run in SI/Freljord control and is Thresh's champion spell. Can be devastating if played into.
Withering Wail,Basically mandatory in SI control decks and Deep. Try to bait it out.
Grasp of the Undying,Run in SI control decks.
Atrocity,Run as a finisher in SI aggro decks and in Feel the Rush decks combined with Tryndamere or Commander Ledros. Hold freezes or removal to bait this card out.
Vengeance,"Play around this if you can, but don't play into The Ruination through overdeveloping either. Unconditional removal is difficult to do much about..."
The Harrowing,"Very common in any sort of aggro deck as a finisher, and splashed into Darius aggro and Elites for blowouts. Save your answers until they play it or try to win early if you can't beat it."
The Ruination,A defining card in SI control decks. Don't avoid playing units entirely if they have 9 mana: try to bait it out and then save development for when they run out of mana.
Frenzied Skitterer,"A key card in Fearsome aggro, Spiders, and Nightfall with Nocturne. Can be summoned out of the Harrowing as well. Make sure you can still block if this is played."
Pale Cascade,"Not as good as it used to be, but still pretty darn good. You can sometimes make things hard for your opponent by open attacking if getting the Nightfall trigger is difficult at Burst."
Hush,"Try to save combat tricks in reserve against this card. It can't prevent effects that have already happened, so if you need e.g., Sejuani or Kallista's level 2 effect you need to trigger them first."
Bastion,Run occasionally in Lee Sin Targon decks and in any Targon decks that need protection. You can save cheap target spells like Vile Feast to beat it.
Moonlight Affliction,"Not a common card, but run in Nightfall decks or Leona/Swain as a finisher. The can't block effect is very scary and need to be planned for."
Gravitum,"Targon only has slow-speed Stuns, so if you need to attack do it before they can play this. If they have 4 mana they can use Gifts From Beyond to phase this."
Crescent Strike,Can be pulled by any card that Invokes 3-or-fewer cost Celestials.
Meteor Shower,Can be pulled by Solari/Lunari Priestess. One of the only direct damage cards in Targon.
Falling Comet,"Unconditional Obliterate is very scary. Save Glimpse Beyond in SI decks that need cards to die, and open attack if you need a unit alive."
Cosmic Rays,"A rare pull from Aurelion Sol or Starshaping, but can cause blowouts."
Supernova,A common pull from Aurelion Sol or Starshaping.
The Serpent,It's easy to forget about 0 mana units.
The Golden Sister,Probably the best pull from Solari/Lunari Priestess. Can be crushing against aggro decks so open attack before they play it.
Twin Discplines,Not a very common card but one of the few good protection spells in Ionia. 
Flurry of Fists,"This card is still new, so expect the unexpected. Can be very scary when combined with Blade of the Exile."
Spirit's Refuge,"Very common in Fiora/Shen lists. If you challenge all of your opponent's blockers, pull them to the end so lethal comes before they heal it back: they lose if that happens."
Nopeify!,"If you only run one or two targets for this, they'll accumulate this card in their hand, so don't let them play it if you can."
Deny,"Assume they run 3 copies: it's that good. Don't play into it with big spells, but if you can't realistically beat this card make them show it: don't lose to a spell they didn't have!"
Concussive Palm,"Mainly run in Karma decks and occasionally in Lee Sin decks. A big development punish, removing an attacker and developing a blocker in one action."
Brittle Steel,Don't block your units below 3 health if this card is a problem.
Troll Chant,"Very common in Freljord decks. They need an ally on board to play it. It also brings you below 0 attack, regardless of what your card shows."
Flash Freeze,Common in Freljord control decks and Ashe decks. Don't play into this with Atrocity or Reckoning. Ashe's champion spell.
Harsh Winds,"Common in Freljord control decks and Ashe decks. Save your combat tricks until after this is played to give it less value. Anivia's champion spell, and can be tutored with Entreat in those decks."
Avalanche,"A defining card in Freljord control decks. Think of it like Ruination: don't let it scare you into never developing, but try to instead bait it out."
Icequake ,"Trundle's champion spell, but not super common outside of that. Like an Avalanche on steroids."
Feel the Rush,K-Pop is scary! Run in Freljord/SI control and also seen in Teemo/Ezreal/Sejuani decks.
Suit Up!,Seeing new life in Fizz/TF decks. Remember it's 2 cost if they drew it last turn.
Mystic Shot,P&Z the card! Ezreal's champion spell and a 3-of in most P&Z decks.
Death Ray - Mk 1,"Viktor's champion spell, although uncommon outside of those decks."
Get Excited! ,"Jinx's champion spell and common in other decks as well. This can summon Jury-Rig or Flame Chompers, but they can't block if you declare your attack first, unlike Rummage or Poro Cannon."
Poro Cannon,A 0-mana discard spell. It's very common to forget that they can play Vision or Survival Skills at 0 mana with this card!
Statikk Shock,"Mainly seen in Ezreal decks. Don't keep units at 1 health if possible, although it's not like those decks don't run other removal..."
Thermogenic Beam,"A common card in P&Z control. The only high-end removal in the region: if you can bait this out it's really, really bad for your opponent."
Tri-beam Improbulator,A core card in Noxus/P&Z decks that aren't discard aggro. Removing your unit doesn't prevent the unit summon.
Aftershock,Yet another burn card: run in lots of decks as landmark removal as well.
Gotcha!,Remember this is 2-mana 3 damage if they drew it this turn.
Sumpworks Map,Not that common but can cause blowouts if you don't think about it before it's too late.
Give It All,Run in Vi/Freljord and in Heimer decks that can cause blowouts. Can be generated from Flash of Brilliance.
Rummage,A 1-mana discard trigger and draw engine for Twisted Fate.
Corina Veraza,Pretty rare: it's mainly run in SI/P&Z control decks. 
Vault Breaker,"A pretty bad card, which is why you don't expect it, but it's Vi's champion spell."
Rising Spell Force,"Also a pretty bad card, which is why it feels even worse to lose to. Consider playing around it if you can."
Trueshot Barrage,"One of the worst cards in the game, but it's a Flash of Brilliance pull that you should be aware of."
Hextech Transmogulator,Basically only seen as a Flash of Brilliance pull.
